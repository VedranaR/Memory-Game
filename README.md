<h4 id="instr">Instructions</h4>
<p>The goal of this game is simply to have fun, while matching the cards together. All the symbols on the cards are connected to the web development, so for someone who is at the beginning of studying it can also be educational. Player is supposed to match every card with its pair containing the same symbol, in the unlimited amount of time, but the more moves are made, the lower rating the player gets.</p>
<p>The game can be reset simply by clicking the restart button on the upper right part of the game board. When two cards are matched, their background turns yellow, and at the end the modal window will appear, giving the player congratulations and game statistics. It will also offer the chance to play again.</p>

<h4 id="contrib">Contributing</h4>
<p>This game is written using only vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3. All the icons are provided by the <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font awesome</a>. The shuffling algorithm is the Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle, which you can find more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle">here</a>. The code is free for anyone to use and build upon it.</p>
